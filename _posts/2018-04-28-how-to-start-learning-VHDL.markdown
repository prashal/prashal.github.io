I would suggest “Circuit Design and Simulation with VHDL” by Volnei A. Pedroni.

This book offers a comprehensive treatment of VHDL and its applications to the design and simulation of real, industry-standard electronic circuits. It focuses on the use of VHDL rather than solely on the language itself. In other words, besides explaining VHDL in detail, it shows why, how and which type of circuits are inferred from the language constructs.

The book also includes a detailed analysis of circuit simulation with VHDL test benches in all of the four categories (nonautomated, fully automated, functional and timing) of simulations. A rigorous discussion is thus made between VHDL for synthesis and VHDL for simulations.

In a nutshell, the book teaches all the indispensable features of VHDL. It also reviews the fundamental concepts of digital electronics and digital design, resulting in a very practical, self contained approach.

In both synthesis and simulation cases the VHDL codes in all design examples are complete and include circuit diagrams, physical synthesis in FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), simulation results and explanatory comments.

All of the four VHDL editions (1987, 1993, 2002 and 2008) are covered.

The book is mainly intended for the students of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering. It will also be useful to the VHDL and digital design engineers and practitioners in the industry.

“Volnei Pedroni explains what designers really need to know to build hardware with VHDL. This book sets the standard for how hardware description languages should be taught.”

A little knowledge on what VLSI is and functioning of various digital combinational and sequential circuits will make the learning easier.

It is known to be quite similar to C Programming, so if you know about C, it will be an added advantage.
