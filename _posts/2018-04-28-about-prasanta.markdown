Experienced Senior Electronics Hardware Design Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the telecommunications industry. Skilled in Optical Communication subsystem design (GPON/DWDM Hardware), Antennas, VHDL/Verilog, C, C++, python, and Embedded Linux. Strong engineering professional with a Master’s Degree focused in RF and Microwave Engineering. 


## Professional Experiences 

#### Design of End user equipment for Access Network 
Design of Optical Network Terminal (ONT) for Gigabit Passive Optical network (ITU-T G.983) that provides triple play services at customer premises

#### Design of Muxponder for DWDM Core network
Design of Optical Transport Network (ITU-T G.709) based 40G Muxponder card which multiplexes four 10G clients into one 40G OTU3/3e signal 

#### Volunteer Projects
  *	Developed and demonstrated an embedded application for runtime upgrade of Network Cards from remote location without affecting datapath.
  *	Developed an application to update firmware of all programmable devices on board using a single interface. 
  *	Designed a desktop application for integrated testing of ONTs thus cutting short the time required for testing each interface of ONT separately.
  *	Was awarded the Employee of the Year under the GPON group in 2013-14.
