I believe that without a GUI, all programs become boring. Hence I tried to write some programs with GUI ofcourse using Visual C++ as compiler.

## Windows Application using VC++ 2010 Express

#### 1. MP3 Player

Simple MP3 player with playlist and library. This project is done as summer project during my graduation. It demonstrates the use of Windows Multimedia SDK, Win32 GUI and custom data structure.
