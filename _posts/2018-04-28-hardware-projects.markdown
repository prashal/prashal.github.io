## Basic VHDL Coding

#### 1. 32-bit Single Precision Floating Point Adder

Floating Point Adder in VHDL and Verification of result with matlab code. TThis project was done as a help assignment of a junior friend. It demonstrates the implementation of IEEE-754 Single Precision floating point format. The 32-bit floating number is divided into 3 parts viz. Mantissa, Exponent and the Sign bit of length 23, 8 and 1 bits accordingly.

Using the above format, the floating point number can be expressed as follows -

(-1)*sign 1.mantissa x 2 ^ exponent
