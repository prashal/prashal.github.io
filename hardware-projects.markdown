## Basic VHDL Coding

#### 1. 32-bit Single Precision Floating Point Adder

Floating Point Adder in VHDL and Verification of result with matlab code. TThis project was done as a help assignment of a junior friend. It demonstrates the implementation of IEEE-754 Single Precision floating point format. The 32-bit floating number is divided into 3 parts viz. Mantissa, Exponent and the Sign bit of length 23, 8 and 1 bits accordingly.

Using the above format, the floating point number can be expressed as follows -

![(-1)*sign 1.mantissa x 2 ^ exponent](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=(-1)^s^i^g^n*(1.mantissa)*2^e^x^p^o^n^e^n^t&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=)
