VHDL stands for VHSIC Hardware Description Language where VHSIC stands for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit. As the name suggests, it is a computer programming language to describe a digital circuit i.e. hardware. The problem with VHDL is the high complexity due to its generality. Introducing learners to the language first, and then showing them how to design digital systems with the language, tends to confuse learners. The language issues tend to distract them from the understanding of digital components. And the synthesis subset issues of the language add to the confusion.

I would suggest “Circuit Design and Simulation with VHDL” by Volnei A. Pedroni. This book offers a comprehensive treatment of VHDL and its applications to the design and simulation of real, industry-standard electronic circuits. It focuses on the use of VHDL rather than solely on the language itself. In other words, besides explaining VHDL in detail, it shows why, how and which type of circuits are inferred from the language constructs. Another very common and nice book is "A VHDL Primer" by Jairam Bhaskar. 

Web pages of classes that use VHDL in academia.

For proper understanding, you should manage time for practice in parallel with reading from book. Most the FPGA/CPLD vendors offers their full featured development tools on trial basis and freeware tools with limited features. Download any freeware simulator for VHDL and try practicing examples from the books.

Other than these [edaplayground](https://www.edaplayground.com/) is a nice platform where you can write and simulate your code online.
